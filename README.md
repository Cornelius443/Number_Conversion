# Number_Conversion

 NumberConversion Project

The NumberConversion project provides utility functions for converting numbers between different bases, including decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.

Getting Started

 Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).
3. Locate the `NumberConversion.java` file and run it.

## Usage

1. The program will prompt you to enter a decimal number, a binary number, and a hexadecimal number.
2. It will then display the converted representations of each number.
3. Additionally, you can perform binary addition by entering two binary numbers.

## Implemented Functions

- `decimalToBinary(int num)`: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation.
- `binaryToDecimal(String binary)`: Converts a binary number to its decimal representation.
- `decimalToHexadecimal(int num)`: Converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.
- `hexadecimalToDecimal(String hexadecimal)`: Converts a hexadecimal number to its decimal representation.
- `binaryToHexadecimal(String binary)`: Converts a binary number to its hexadecimal representation.
- `hexadecimalToBinary(String hexadecimal)`: Converts a hexadecimal number to its binary representation.
- `binaryAddition(String binary1, String binary2)`: Performs binary addition on two binary numbers.
